# Machine-Learning-Image-Inpainting-with-RBF-Regression
- Using a machine learning algorithm with RBF Regression, this algorithm model recognizes the image and converts it into a 2D array.
- 
- It then models an image as a function I(x) that specifies brightness as a function of position with a value from 0 to 1 using radial basis functions.
